# Smart-Python-Terminal
Hello! I am currently learning the python language, as it really interests me and therefore I decided to make a small project to familiarize myself with the basic syntax of the language. Keep in mind, this project is by no means complex but I personally think the best way to manifest knowledge is by creating small practical projects. Enjoy!
